## DailyReport (1 sentence)
Setting up an ApplicationLoadBalancer with Listeners and TargetGroups.

## Obstacles
CfnLoadbalancer config syntax explanation is not correct, i.e. my configuration of 'load_balancer_attributes' is not having any effect in the console.

## Solutions
* AWS doc's: 
    - Amazon Elastic Load Balancing V2 Construct Library.
    - CfnLoadBalancer page
    - CfnListener page
* Google Gemini.

## Learnings 
Still stuck, just stay composed and carry on.
