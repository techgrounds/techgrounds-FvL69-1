## DailyReport (1 sentence)
I've customized all resources in my code and it works nicely now. 

## Obstacles
Had a lot of trouble with CDK making resources that i had build also, especially subnet-routeTable-associations. Could not deploy because of it.

## Solucions
I found the right way to retrieve my subnet id that i had to implement into several resources, e.g. the nat gateway.

## Learnings 
I get Errors over an incorrect syntax that looks correct and works for other resources. The error msg is not always clear about what exactly the problem is. So i did a lot of reading and searching in the wrong direction.
