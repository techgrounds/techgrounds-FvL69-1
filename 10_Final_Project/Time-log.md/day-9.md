## DailyReport (1 sentence)  
Created vpc2 and made adjustments to IaC code for attributes. Also vpc peering is created, everything deploys well, looks okay in AWS console.

## Obstacles  
I don't know yet how to code the routing to my isolated subnet in vpc2 without attaching it to a gateway.

## Solucions  
I attached it to a gateway for now. I wanted to know if i could deploy my 2nd vpc correctly.

## Learnings   
I've created the vpc peering connection with help of intellisense in vs code.
