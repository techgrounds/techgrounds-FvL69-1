## DailyReport (1 sentence)
The current code is not working properly, finding the correct way of getting the right id syntax for resource attributes is a pain. I'm not sure why this is.

## Obstacles
I'm getting errors when deploying the code.

## Solucions
i've decided to make structural changes to my code. e.g. creating custom subnets instead of vpc generated subnets.

## Learnings 
I started this project with a too advanced example from a YouTub video. Building from the ground up is much better to get a better understanding of how aws cdk works. It's rather complex to figure out how things work without any help from an expert. But it's fun too.
