## DailyReport (1 sentence)
Tried to configure admin server but ran into errors, tried ec2.CfnInstance instead of ec2.Instance(), spend the whole day adjusting SG and routes and all but to no avail. I restored the whole code back to former state.

## Obstacles
Not sure why i'm getting errors and how to solve them. To many problems rose.

## Solucions
Restored to former state, SG and ingress rule functions again. Routing vpc2 still not solved.

## Learnings 
It's hard to find specific doc's for errors.
