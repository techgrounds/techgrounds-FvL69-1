## DETECTION, RESPONSE and ANALYSIS:

What technologies and strategies to use regarding detecting, preventing and recovering  
from a cyber attack.  

## KEY-TERMS:

* IDS = Intrusion Detection System    
* IPS = Intrusion Prevention System  
* SYSTEM HARDENING = Systems hardening is a collection of tools, techniques, and best practices to reduce vulnerability in   
  technology applications, systems, infrastructure,  firmware, and other areas.
* RP0 = Recovery Point Objective (Up to what amount of time can your business be without a set amount of data before business operations begin to suffer)  
* RTO = Recovery Time Objective (How much time will it take to recover after an alert of business process disruption)  

## Study:
* IDS and IPS.  
* Hack response strategies.  
* The concept of systems hardening.  
* Different types of disaster recovery options.  

## ASSIGNMENT:

* A Company makes daily backups of their database. The database is automatically recovered when a failure happens using the  
  most recent available backup. The recovery happens on a different physical machine than the original database,   
  and the entire process takes about 15 minutes. What is the RPO of the database?  

* An automatic failover to a backup web server has been configured for a website. Because the backup has to be powered on   
  first and has to pull the newest version of the website from GitHub, the process takes about 8 minutes. What is the RTO of the website?

## RESULT:

A Company makes daily backups of their database. The database is automatically recovered when a failure happens   
using the most recent available backup. The recovery happens on a different physical machine than the original database,   
and the entire process takes about 15 minutes. 

What is the RPO of the database?  

**Answer:** MAX 24 uur
