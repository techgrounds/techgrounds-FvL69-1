## CORE SERVICES:

There are a lot of services in AWS, but some are more important than others. AWS lists the following key services that   
you should have some in-depth knowledge about for the Cloud Practitioner exam.  


## KEY-SERVICES:

* Amazon EC2 = Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity.  
* AWS Lambda = With Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consume.  
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk =  upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning,   
  load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.  
* Amazon VPC = Amazon Virtual Private Cloud enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud   
  where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you've defined.  
* Amazon Route 53 = A highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.  
* Amazon S3 = You can use Simple Storage Service to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.  
* Amazon S3 Glacier = Simple Storage Service optimized for infrequently used data, or "cold data." The service provides durable and extremely   
  low-cost storage with security features for data archiving and backup.
* Amazon CloudFront = Speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .php, image, and media files.   
  When users request your content, CloudFront delivers it through a worldwide network of edge locations that provide low latency and high performance.   
* Amazon RDS = Relational Database Service is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.   
* Amazon DynamoDB = Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.  
* Amazon CloudWatch = CloudWatch provides a reliable, scalable, and flexible monitoring solution that you can start using within minutes.  
* Amazon CloudFormation = CloudFormation enables you to create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. It helps   
  you leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly reliable,   
highly scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.  
* Amazon Identity and Access Management = Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services.   
  With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.
