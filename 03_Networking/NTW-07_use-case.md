### Explanation:

* A public subnet for the webshop database, web server and a firewall before the internet gateway.
* A private subnet for the 5 work stations and printer connected to a switch connected to a NAT gateway.
* A 2nd private subnet for the AD server and file server connected to private subnet 1 switch.

For security reasons the switch is connected to a NAT gateway which is connected to the public subnet firewall.
