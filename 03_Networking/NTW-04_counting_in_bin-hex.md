## COUNTING IN BINARY AND HEX:

* Binary numbers are important because using them instead of the decimal system simplifies the design of computers and related technologies.  

* The main advantage of a Hexadecimal Number is that it is very compact and by using a base of 16 means that the number of digits used   
  to represent a given number is usually less than in binary or decimal.  

## KEY-TERMS:

* binary = a base 2 number  
* decimal = a base 10 number  
* hexadecimal = a base 16 number

### Binary 10011000 is 152 Decimal

### For decimal to binary: 154 in binary:

* Start subtracting the highest number in the decimal line above from 154 and work your way to the right.  
* **If you can subtract notate a 1, if not notate a 0.**  

|decimal calc      |bin output|
|:-----------------|:---------|  
|154 - 128 = 26    | 1        |  
| 26 - 64 = not pos| 10       |  
| 26 - 32 = np     | 100      |  
| 26 - 16 = 10     | 1001     |  
| 10 - 8 = 2       | 10011    |  
| 2 - 4 = np       | 100110   | 
| 2 - 2 = 0        | 1001101  |  
| 0 -1 = np        | 10011010 |    

So, 154 in binary is: 10011010  

* Smallest 8 bit binary: 0000 0000 = 0  
* Largest 8 bit binary: 1111 1111 = 255

## HEXADECIMAL base 16.

### The hexadecimal digit is expanded to multiply each digit with the power of 16.  
### The power starts at 0 from the right moving forward towards the left with the increase in power.  

### |16^7|16^6|16^5|16^4|16^3|16^2|16^1|16^0|  

**Hexa = 6 + decimal = 10  --> Hexadecimal = 16**  

0 -> 0 | 10 -> A  
1 -> 1 | 11 -> B  
2 -> 2 | 12 -> C    
3 -> 3 | 13 -> D  
4 -> 4 | 14 -> E  
5 -> 5 | 15 -> F  
6 -> 6  
7 -> 7  
8 -> 8  
9 -> 9  


### How to calculate from decimal to hex:
479 -> hex  

479 : 16 = 29.9375  
this leaves an integer of 29 and a remainder of .9375  
16 * .9375 = 15

29 : 16 = 1.8125 
this leaves an integer of 1 and a remainder of .8125  
16 * .8125 = 13

1 : 16 = 0.0625 
this leaves 0 and a remainder of .0625  
16 * .0625 = 1  
when you get to 0 you stop  

To form the hexadecimal you start with the 'most significant number' which is 1 (the last remainder)  
Then go up to the 'least significant number', which is 15 (the first remainder)  
So this comes down to 1 which is equivalent to 1 in hex, then 13 which is equivalent to d in hex  
then 15 which is equivalent to f in hex.  

### decimal 479 == hex 1df
