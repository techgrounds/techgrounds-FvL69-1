## LINUX-3 WORKING WITH TEXT:

**Working with text**

Every command in Linux has a standard input and output.
The standard input (stdin) is the keyboard.

The standard output (stdout) is the terminal.

Both the input and output can be redirected to a file instead of the default. This is called input redirection and output redirection.

A pipe can be used to have the output of one command be the input of another command.


## KEY-TERMS:

Echo = command to write to (stdout)

cat > 'filename' = redirect input to file

cat >> 'filename' = append text to file

grep = Grep is a Linux / Unix command-line tool used to search for a string or characters in a specified file.

cat 'filename' = read content of file to stdout, the terminal


## OPDRACHT:

* Use the echo command and output redirection to write a new sentence into your text
file using the command line. The new sentence should contain the word ‘techgrounds’.

* Use a command to write the contents of your text file to the terminal. Make use of a
command to filter the output so that only the sentence containing ‘techgrounds’ appears.

* Read your text file with the command used in the second step, once again filtering   for the word   ‘techgrounds’. This time, redirect the output to a new file called ‘techgrounds.txt’.
